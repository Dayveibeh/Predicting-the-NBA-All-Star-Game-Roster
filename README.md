# Predicting-the-NBA-All-Star-Game-Roster
This project explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to accurately predict the National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game roster.

Using players' performance metrics and significant attributes, various algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks, and others, were used to predict All-Star selections. This project undertook data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy. Evaluation metrics such as AUC ROC and recall were chosen instead of accuracy due to an oversampling technique applied to the target variable. XGBoost and Random Forest were the top performing models, and they successfully predicted the All-Star roster for the 2022/2023 season. The findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning in sports prediction, offering valuable insights for player development and decision-making. This project work achieved high accuracy and ROC AUC scores, surpassing previous works, and paving the way for further advancements in sports analytics
